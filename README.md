## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end customer segmentation and marketing analysis using real-world-style data from a Portuguese retail company. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, purchase history, and responses to multiple marketing campaigns — both online and offline.

The objective is to segment customers based on their behavior and demographics, evaluate campaign effectiveness, and recommend targeted marketing strategies to improve engagement and ROI.

## 🎯 Business Objective

> "Who are our most valuable customers, and how can we engage them better across online and offline channels?"

Retail stakeholders want to identify:
- Which customer segments are most profitable?
- How marketing campaigns are performing across demographics and channels?
- What strategies can re-engage passive or low-spending customers?

## 📈 Key Business Insights

1. **Cluster 1** (high-income, older adults) are top spenders and highly responsive to campaigns — especially wine and meat products.
2. **Younger customers** prefer web/catalog purchases but show lower engagement and spend.
3. **Seniors and families with children** are under-engaged and require reactivation strategies.
4. **Customer tenure** positively correlates with loyalty and total spend.
